# Dynamic Input Box With Checkboxes

Here is a Webpage just like the Dynamic Input Box page except it uses an if statement inside of the JavaScript function to check if checkbox is checked. For all checkboxes that are unchecked,
whatever is typed into the input box is also typed into the paragraph. If a user checks a checkbox, that paragraph does nothing.
