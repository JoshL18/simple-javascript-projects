# Dynamic Paragraphs With Text Box

This program takes input from a textbox and dynamically adds that text to the five paragraphs below.
HTML builds the website with sections for the text box and the paragraphs. JavaScript takes the text box and paragraphs then sets their values equal using a for loop and an array.
